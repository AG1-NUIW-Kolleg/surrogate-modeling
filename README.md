# Project Title
Surrogate Modeling for muscle models.

## Description
This repository explores and applies surrogate modeling techniques in the
context of muscle models.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

> This `README.md` only covers the setup of using `Linux`. If you are using `Windows` only or `macOS`, feel free to update the `README.md` with the necessary steps.

```cmd
pip install virtualenv
```

### Installing

First, clone the repository by running:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/AG1-NUIW-Kolleg/surrogate-modeling.git
```

After that, create a virtual environment with:
```cmd
python -m venv .venv
```

Active the virtual environment by running:
```cmd
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the dependencies with:
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Executing program

Run the `main.py` file from root with:
